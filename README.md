🌟 Hey there! I'm Emanuele, but you can call me @noostale.

🤖 I'm a computer engineer with a huge crush on AI. My journey in the AI world has been a mix of tinkering with neural networks, playing with machine learning algorithms, and always being on the lookout for something new and exciting.

🔍 Things I'm into:
- Crafting and fine-tuning machine learning algorithms
- Applying deep learning in the real world
- Diving into natural language understanding models

📚 When I'm not coding, I'm probably:
- Reading some of the latest papers on machine learning
- Hacking away at hackathons and coding competitions
